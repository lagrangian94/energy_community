The six-player baseline community consists of one wind producer with electric storage (u1), one electrolyzer (u2), one heat pump (u3), and three pure consumers for electricity, hydrogen, and heat (u4--u6), respectively. To scale this setting, we augment the community with nine additional players that introduce technology heterogeneity, prosumer structures, and inter-sector competition. On the supply side, we add a solar generator with electric storage (u7), a second electrolyzer equipped with hydrogen storage (u8), a second heat pump equipped with thermal storage (u9), and a vertically integrated player owning both wind generation and an electrolyzer with hydrogen and electric storage (u10). The storage asymmetry between u2 and u8 (and between u3 and u9) allows us to examine how storage ownership affects the pricing outcomes. We also introduce a standalone battery storage operator (u11) that participates solely through temporal arbitrage. On the demand side, we add a residential prosumer with rooftop solar and electricity demand (u12), a hydrogen consumer (u13), a heat prosumer owning a heat pump alongside heat demand (u14), and a residential complex consuming both electricity and heat (u15). This configuration yields six players with integer commitment variables (u2, u3, u8, u9, u10, u14).
