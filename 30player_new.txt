The 30-player community retains all 15 players above and appends 15 more to test scalability and richer inter-sector interactions. On the supply side, we add a second wind producer (u16, 0.8$\times$ baseline capacity), a second solar generator (u17, 1.3$\times$), an electrolyzer with hydrogen storage (u18, both 1.2$\times$), an electrolyzer without storage (u19, 0.6$\times$), a heat pump with thermal storage (u20, 1.0$\times$ baseline), and a solar-integrated electrolyzer representing a solar-to-hydrogen pathway (u21, solar 0.5$\times$, electrolyzer 0.8$\times$). A second standalone battery operator (u22, 1.5$\times$ baseline ESS) is also included. On the demand side, we model three consumer archetypes: residential complexes consuming both electricity and heat, hydrogen refueling stations, and industrial facilities consuming electricity and hydrogen. Among the new demand-side players, u23 is a residential prosumer with rooftop solar (0.3$\times$) and reduced electricity (0.5$\times$) and heat (0.4$\times$) demand, u24 is a residential consumer with behind-the-meter battery storage and electricity (0.8$\times$) and heat (0.3$\times$) demand, u25 is a residential pure consumer with electricity (0.6$\times$) and heat (0.3$\times$) demand, u26 is a refueling station with a solar canopy (0.4$\times$) and hydrogen demand (0.6$\times$), u27 is a pure hydrogen consumer (0.5$\times$), u28 is an industrial pure consumer with electricity (0.9$\times$) and hydrogen (0.5$\times$) demand, u29 is an industrial consumer with battery storage and electricity (0.7$\times$) and hydrogen (0.4$\times$) demand, and u30 is a pure heat consumer (0.3$\times$). The demand multipliers are chosen so that aggregate demand grows roughly in proportion to aggregate supply capacity when scaling from 15 to 30 players. The 30-player community contains ten players with integer commitment variables (u2, u3, u8, u9, u10, u14, u18, u19, u20, u21), and exhaustive enumeration of its $2^{30}-1 \approx 10^9$ coalitions is computationally infeasible.
