The 30-player community retains all 15 players above and appends 15 more. On the supply side, we add a second wind producer (u16), a second solar generator (u17), an electrolyzer with hydrogen storage (u18), an electrolyzer without storage (u19), a heat pump with thermal storage (u20), and a solar-integrated electrolyzer (u21) representing a solar-to-hydrogen pathway. A second standalone battery operator (u22) is also included. On the demand side, we model residential complexes as electricity-and-heat consumers, hydrogen refueling stations as hydrogen consumers, and industrial facilities as electricity-and-hydrogen consumers. Among the new demand-side players, u23 is a residential prosumer with rooftop solar, u24 owns a behind-the-meter battery, u26 is a refueling station with a solar canopy, and u29 is an industrial prosumer with battery storage. The remaining demand-side players (u25, u27, u28, u30) are pure consumers. Capacities for the new producers and prosumer assets are drawn at $0.5$--$1.5$ times the corresponding baseline values to introduce heterogeneity. The 30-player community contains ten players with integer variables, and exhaustive enumeration of its $2^{30}-1 \approx 10^9$ coalitions is computationally infeasible.
